ENEMIES:
	Mortar: 
		A cannon that fires heat seeking missiles at you, which can be destroyed.
	Death Ray: 
		A giant ray gun in the background that periodically fires rays high into the sky. These rays show 
		a short warning before blasting down at a high speed straight down over the player, with just enough 
		time for them to move out of the way.
